A "sneeze" in early summer, the city was suddenly deserted. Be strong Saigon!</h4>

So the city will have a very quiet month to recuperate. There is a strange feeling when the city that is always remembered for its rushed and vibrant atmosphere now sinks into a silence and sadness. Life seems to stop on busy roads. The workers hid under the trees, looking sadder because these days are really hard...
<br/><br/>
In group chats, friends text each other and drop the link to notify the distance. Plans are delayed, work is more difficult. But even at this time, even the most worried person is optimistic, because everyone believes in the strong vitality and spirit of Saigon. Get well soon, so that no one can be grumpy in the hot June, so that we can see a joyful Saigon again.
